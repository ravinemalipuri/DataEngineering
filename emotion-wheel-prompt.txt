# Interactive Emotion Wheel Application - Complete Prompt

## Project Overview
Create a responsive, interactive emotion wheel web application that helps users explore and understand human emotions through visual representation. The application should be bilingual (English and Telugu) and built using modern web technologies.

## Core Features

  - Large circular wheel (900x900px) with three concentric rings
  - Each emotion segment uses color-coded visualization
  - Smooth hover effects and click interactions
  - Radially aligned text that rotates with segments
  - High contrast text with white shadows for readability

- **Interactivity:**
  - Click primary emotions to view detailed breakdown
  - Hover effects for visual feedback
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Responsive design that works on all devices

### 2. Bilingual Support

- **Complete translation coverage:**
  - All emotion names (primary, secondary, tertiary)
  - UI labels and descriptions
  - Help text and instructions
  - Navigation elements

### 3. User Interface Components

- **Lucide React** for icons

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface EmotionLevel1 {
  id: string;
  color: string;
  en: string;
  te: string;
  level2Emotions: EmotionLevel2[];
}

interface EmotionLevel2 {
  id: string;
  en: string;
  te: string;
  level3Emotions: EmotionLevel3[];
}

interface EmotionLevel3 {
  id: string;
  en: string;
  te: string;
}
```

#### Emotion Mapping (Complete List)

**Primary Emotions (8 total):**
1. Happy (సంతోషం) - #FFD700

**Secondary Emotions (detailed breakdown for each primary):**
- Each primary emotion has 6-8 secondary emotions
- Examples: Playful, Content, Interested, Proud, Accepted, Powerful, Peaceful, Trusting, Optimistic (under Happy)

**Tertiary Emotions (detailed breakdown for each secondary):**
- Each secondary emotion has 2-3 specific tertiary emotions
- Examples: Aroused, Cheeky (under Playful), Free, Joyful (under Content)
