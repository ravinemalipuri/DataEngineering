    howToUse: "How to Use the Emotion Wheel",
    howToUseIntro: "Understanding how someone truly feels—whether it's your child, partner, or family member—can be challenging. The emotion wheel is a helpful tool that allows you to look beyond surface-level reactions and uncover the deeper emotions behind them.",
    howToUseSteps: "Start by identifying the primary emotion being expressed, such as anger, sadness, or joy. Then, look closer: most primary emotions are triggered by one or more tertiary emotions—more specific feelings like frustration, guilt, or hope.",
    howToUseConversation: "Use the wheel to guide a conversation or observation. Ask gentle questions, or reflect on behaviors, to move from the obvious emotion to the root cause. For example, a child showing anger might actually be feeling rejected or embarrassed.",
    howToUsePurpose: "This tool is not just for labeling feelings—it's a way to build empathy, connection, and emotional awareness in your relationships.",

    example1Title: "For a Child (Elementary Age)",
    example1Text: "Your child comes home from school and says, \"I hate school!\" That sounds like anger, but using the emotion wheel, you might explore deeper. Maybe they felt excluded at recess or embarrassed after giving a wrong answer in class. What they're really feeling could be hurt or shame—not just anger.",
    example1Question: "\"Did something happen today that made you feel left out?\"",

    example2Title: "For an Elderly Adult (Like a Grandparent)",
    example2Text: "Your grandparent seems grumpy or withdrawn and says, \"Nobody ever visits me.\" It might sound like anger or bitterness, but look deeper—maybe they feel lonely, forgotten, or even afraid of losing connection.",
    example2Response: "\"Are you feeling a bit alone today? Want to talk or go for a walk?\"",
    example2Try: "Try responding with:",
    
    exampleConclusion: "This helps shift the focus from reaction to real emotion—and opens space for care and connection."
